# sfsScorer: Scores child psychometric questionnaires using norms from the Spit for Science study

Spit for Science (SFS) was a cross-sectional mental health study
performed by Dr. Crosbie and Dr. Schachar, in which over 40,000 child
and youth participants contributed genetic and questionnaire data. SFS
is one of the largest studies to examine child and youth mental health,
and as such, it has been used to validate multiple psychometric
questionnaires. This package scores and produces t-scoresfor the SFS
questionnaires, i.e. the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and
Normal Behavior Rating Scale (SWAN), the Toronto Obsessive-Compulsive
Scale (TOCS), etc.
